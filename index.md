## 1.	Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
User Defined Functions allow you to create and use custom functions. UDFs are useful when there isn’t a built-in function that will return the value that you are looking for. They’re also good to use because they accept parameters and can perform actions, such as calculations. They can return either single values or a set of results.

### 2.	Explain the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
Scalar functions return a single value whenever they are used. Inline and multi-statement functions are types of scalar functions. Inline scalar functions return the result of a single statement. Multi-statement scalar functions on the other hand can have multiple SQL statements that return a single value.
